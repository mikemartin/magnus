The best of the best, at this moment, in my opinion... and in no particular order. I'm just that helpful. View the playlist [here](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1nANERtCv5u50kclb9UF87?si=uhvtQEOiTmyJg4Ak_Uz3qA).

1. ### Trustafarian - Lionize
Killer track of the new album Superczar and the Vulture. Listen to the chorus and you’ll get it. Amazing rock moment

2. ### Red Tide Rising - Orange Goblin
Hard hitting grooves from over the pond. The riffs compel the ear and hold the mind.

3. ### Jekyll & Hyde - Marcus Miller
This is probably the heaviest hitting tune from one of the all time greats. Ever heard of Miles Davis? Well Miles heard of Marcus. Enough said.

4. ### The Northern - Alexis on Fire
Arguably the best track they ever wrote. The strength and emotion of Dallas’ voice is all the more powerful against such a moody and powerful sonic landscape.

5. ### The Birthing - Baroness
If complex rhythms and intricate riffs get you going then this will never let you slow down. Pure power, start to finish.

6. ### Dark Side of Me - Coheed and Cambria
Coheed have always been a band that carried itself on expression and experimentation. This is just another beautiful guitar driven masterpiece. An acquired taste, but well worth the effort.

7. ### God is dead - Black Sabbath
A new entry from the originals. Black Sabbath needs no accolades to prove their worth. The best are still the best.

8. ### Dust Bowl - Joe Bonamassa
The king of diy blues is clearly at the top of his game. Just killer guitar all over this track.

9. ### Never Come Back - Stolen Babies
Ever wonder what would happen if Tim Burton started a metal band? Stolen Babies is about as close as you'll ever get. Rich and complex music with fantastic vocals. Grade A.

10. ### Dirty Walls - Our Lady Peace
Not just for Canadian content, Naveed has always been one of my favorite sunny day albums. This track always stands out in my mind.
