MAGNUS RISING have spent the past decade touring coast-to-coast, pushing their way through Canada with their heavy melodic sound. They’re not stopping now - this is no time to lie down. Fresh off a recent cross-Canada tour, Magnus Rising is getting ready to release their upcoming full-length album, Whatever It Takes, on May 31st. On the same day, the band is hosting an album release party at Rickshaw in Vancouver. Doors are at 7 PM and the show begins at 8 PM. See the event poster below for details.

The band plans to release a new music video for the track ‘The Drill’ later this month. Stay tuned for more details coming soon. 

Whatever It Takes is about making music on the band’s terms and defying the odds – and odds they have defied! Even after having their rehearsal studio burn down several years ago, taking $20,000 worth in equipment with it, plus moving 7,000 miles across Canada to Vancouver, the band was able to turn right around and release their first full-length, Counting The Numbers, establishing their presence as a force in the West Coast scene. 

It’s been ten years since guitarist Roger Cranford took out a newspaper ad seeking other musicians to help him take up the reins. Ten years of road trips and midnight rehearsals was what was expected. From the very first session, Magnus Rising vocalist Aaron Hawkins and bassist Matt Snow realized they had something real, something that felt right - something to fight for. Once moving to Vancouver as mentioned above, they found drummer Nick James. Not only has James has become a rock on which the group can stand, but he has also rounded out that heavy sound that has been in development so long. 

Magnus Rising have soared, trekking back and forth across the country, always working to rock bigger crowds in more badass venues. In their western home, they’ve opened for metal powerhouses ICED EARTH, FORBIDDEN and RAVEN – bands who have showed them that time is irrelevant. Their dedication has paid off in droves building a sound all their own. Layered with emotion, feeling and aggression, Magnus Rising is reminiscent of a passionate punch in the jaw. 

Magnus Rising are no longer just contenders, they’re ready for the belt. More on the band at [this location](http://www.facebook.com/magnusrisingband).
