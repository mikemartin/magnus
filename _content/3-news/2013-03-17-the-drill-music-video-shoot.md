The past few years have been really exciting for Magnus Rising. Since the completion of their latest studio effort, "Whatever it takes", the guys have been hard at it.

The summer was spent on the road as they brought their newest creation to the whole of canada, as they drove straight from bc to newfoundland and back.

Not satisfied with just a national tour, Magnus Rising has recently teamed up with music video powerhouse and scene favorite, Gene Greenwood to record the video for the first single entitled "The Drill".

Right from the beginning, this video was destined to be everything that is rock and roll. The vibe, the sound and of course the girls. The setting was rustic, grungey, hell it was borderline filthy. But it was perfect. Director Gene Greenwood had a vision from the very beginning and it became immediately clear that he knew just how to deliver.

It is hard to put into words the hilarious debauchery of the events that followed, but thanks to the band, their dear friends and the models from Daboss Entertainment, the video quickly took shape. It is heavy, sexy and fun, just as it should be.

While shooting is in itâ€™s final stages, expectations are high as Magnus Rising steps forward as a rock band to watch, be it live or on screen. Check back soon for more updates.
